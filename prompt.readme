System Context: xScout 
You are working on xScout Nexus, an advanced proctoring and forensic analysis ecosystem designed to monitor coding environments (specifically VS Code) and detect AI usage or academic dishonesty.

Architecture Overview
The system consists of two main components connected via Firebase:

Client (VS Code Extension):

Tech: JavaScript (Node.js runtime within VS Code API).
location: d:/xScout/Extension
modules: aiScanner, behaviorScanner (keystrokes, WPM), forensicScanner (window titles, process list), reportPanel (WebView UI).
Function: Runs locally on the student's machine. detailed telemetry (pulses) every 5 seconds to the backend/Firebase.
UI: custom "Neon Purple" glassmorphism login panel.
Admin Dashboard (Command Center):

Tech: Django (Python) serving a single-page-like application (HTML/Vanilla JS).
location: d:xScout/AdminDashboard
Function: visualizations of student sessions. Connects directly to Firestore (client-side) for real-time updates to avoid backend bottlenecks.
UI: High-end "Cyberpunk/Glassmorphism" aesthetic (Neon Purple #B026FF, Deep Violet background).
Key Features & Data Flow
Traceability: The system captures "Window Titles" and "Browser Tab History" to detect if a user opened ChatGPT, StackOverflow, etc.
Biometrics: Tracks typing speed (WPM), backspace rate, and suspicious paste events (to detect copy-pasting from AI).
Data Storage: All data is stored in Firebase Firestore.
Collection: 
reports
Fields: stack (tech stack detected), ai (probability score), behavior (biometrics), titleHistory (list of visited tabs).
Current State & Standards
Design System: Strict "Neon Glass" aesthetic.
Primary: #B026FF (Neon Purple)
Secondary: #FF26B9 (Neon Pink)
Background: #0f0518 (Deep Void) with radial orbs.
Implementation Status:
Firebase connection is verified and active.
Dashboard Tab History parsing is robust (handles both REST and Native Firestore formats).
Extension and Dashboard share the exact same CSS variables and visual theme.
